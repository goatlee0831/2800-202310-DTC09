#How to use the product

	As a regular user start by making an account and logging in. Here you can browse the tasks that the futuristic AI is recommending or create one of your own and post it to the jobs board. The jobs that you have posted will be dynamically be generated under All Tasks. 

	As a gofer you also need to signup and login but also wait for an interview from an admin. For the purposes of the demo the gofer can start accepting jobs from the jobs board immediately. They can view the ones they can accept, the ones they have already accepted and the ones they have completed. 

The login credentials for a generic user are:
Username: jerrya
Password: jerrya

The login credentials for a Gofer (someone who can complete jobs) is:
Username: soyoung
Password: soyoung

Tasks list
	ChatGPT was used to generate our task list.

#How did you use AI? Tell us exactly what AI services and products you used and how you used them. Be very specific:

We didnâ€™t use chatgpt though we did use copilot and though it made writing code faster, it often suggested unwanted code. 
We did use Chatgpt to generate lists of fake data for our database. We asked it to creat a list of fake jobs and we provided it with the schema that we wanted it in.
Our App does NOT use any AI
ChatGPT does not always follow instructions so we had to manually fix our data.
